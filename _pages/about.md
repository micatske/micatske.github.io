I am a Ph.D. student of mathematics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, researching partial differential equations(PDE). Besides my focus on PDE, I am also interested in data science and machine learning.

I enjoy exploring the world. I was born and raised in China, finished my undergraduate in the U.S., and am now doing my graduate study in Switzerland.

I spend my spare time with the music. I play the violin and go to concerts regularly. Also, I am an [audiophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiophile).
