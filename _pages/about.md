I am a Phd student of mathematics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne researching partial differential equations(PDE). Besides my focus on PDE, I am also interested in data science and machine learning.

I enjoy exploring the world. I was born and raised in China, finished my undergraduate in the U.S., and am now doing my graduate study in Switzerland.
