excerpt: ' We prove global well-posedness for the half-wave map with $S^2$ target for small $\dot{H}^{\frac{n}{2}} \times \dot{H}^{\frac{n}{2}-1}$ initial data. We also prove the global well-posedness  for the equation with $\Hy$ target for small smooth $\besov \times \dot{B}^{\frac{n}{2}-1}_{2,1}$ initial data.'
